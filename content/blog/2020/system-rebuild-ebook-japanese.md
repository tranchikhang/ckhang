### Why you want to rebuild a system?
One of the most common reason for companies decide to rebuild their system is the aging of their systems.
Because business environment keeps changing rapidly, system needs to be updated to adapt to new requirements. Every time, the system becomes larger and more complex, and the number of troubles is increasing in many areas. As a result, a significant maintenance is required.

Then there will be a "turning point", where system is no longer sufficient to respond to changes in business. The company has to decide a partial rebuild or complete rebuild, depends on the gap between what the system can do and what the company needs now and in the future.

### Guide book
In order to make system rebuild a success, the [Software Reliability Enhancement Center](https://www.ipa.go.jp/sec/about/info.html) of [Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%83%85%E5%A0%B1%E5%87%A6%E7%90%86%E6%8E%A8%E9%80%B2%E6%A9%9F%E6%A7%8B) (or IPA in short) has published a book called システム再構築を成功に導くユーザガイド (you can find the second version [here](https://www.ipa.go.jp/sec/publish/tn16-009.html).

I came across this ebook while searching on the internet for system rebuild materials. As I have zero experience with these kinds of stuff, and my current tasks at work are investigating and analyzing customer's system, giving consultation to user, this ebook is really helpful.

There are 4 parts, I will try to translate them into English :
* 解説編 (Explanation): When and why we need to build a new system etc
* 再構築手法選択編 (How to choose a system rebuild method): Steps to investigate, analyze current system and pick out the rebuild method.
* 計画策定編 (Planning): Explain some viewpoints to consider when planning for system rebuild
* 事例編 (Case study)

I think this is a great book for anyone who is working with system analysis, design etc., especially in Japanese company, or just to gain more knowledge about IT, system etc in general.
