# About
\
My name is Khang, I am a Bridge system engineer working in Tokyo.
\
\
I used to work as a developer for a few years, mostly with PHP at backend, Angular at frontend, sometimes .Net related stuff.
\
\
Nowadays I spend most of my time at work analyzing client requirements, creating document and other various things.
\
\
I created this site to put anything that I find interesting here, from programming to things I learned at work (may be some game development related posts in the future too).
