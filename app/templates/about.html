        <p>My name is Khang, I am a software developer working in Tokyo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™m mostly a Full stack PHP web developer, sometimes .Net. I'm also learning Angular and Python for future projects.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This website is built using Flask, I plan to use it to put anything that I find interesting here, and also for playing around with python.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is nothing here for now, you can checkout my <a href="https://github.com/tranchikhang/">Github</a> for some unfinished side projects I've been working with in my free time.</p>
