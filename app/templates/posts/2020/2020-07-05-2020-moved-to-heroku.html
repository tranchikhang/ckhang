        I was thinking about moving to Heroku a few weeks ago. My site has been running on Vultr cheapest plan ($3.5 per month) about half year now. I never had really any issue with Vultr, it just that I don't use my site that much, and Heroku free tier should be enough for my needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        The process was easier than I thought. I just need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Register an account.</li>
            <li>Create an app on Heroku, I can do it directly on their site.</li>
            <li>Connect to my Github repo in a few clicks.</li>
            <li>Create a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile">Procfile</a> then edit some code to change module path.</li>
            <li>Go to deploy page, "Manual deploy" section, set the branch and click "Deploy branch" (I haven't tried the Automatic deploys feature yet).</li>
        </ul>
        That's all, my site is online now.
